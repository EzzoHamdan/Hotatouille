# Hotatouille
 Hotatouille was developed as an interactive application to showcase my proficiency in project development for the Visual Programming course I took during my first semester of sophomore year. The project was a practical demonstration of my understanding of core concepts of visual programming, allowing users to browse hotels and make reservations.
